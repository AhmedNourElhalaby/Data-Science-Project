"machine vision is one of the four cornerstones of Computer Science. It involves finding the similarities or patterns among small, decomposed problems that can help us solve more complex problems more efficiently. ",F
"machine vision is image processing, the computer-based identification, analysis, and classification of objects, features, or other meaningful regularities within an image. ",F
"machine vision is a branch of machine learning that focuses on the recognition of patterns and regularities in data, although it is in some cases considered to be nearly synonymous with machine learning. Pattern recognition systems are in many cases trained from labeled ""training"" data (supervised learning), but when no labeled data are available other algorithms can be used to discover previously unknown patterns (unsupervised learning).

"Fuzzy logic is an approach to computing based on ""degrees of truth"" rather than the usual ""true or false"" (1 or 0) Boolean logic on which the modern computer is based. ",T5
" Fuzzy logic is a form of many-valued logic in which the truth values of variables may be any real number between 0 and 1. It is employed to handle the concept of partial truth, where the truth value may range between completely true and completely false.[1] By contrast, in Boolean logic, the truth values of variables may only be the integer values 0 or 1.",T5
"Fuzzy logic is a logic operations method based on many-valued logic rather than binary logic (two-valued logic). Two-valued logic often considers 0 to be false and 1 to be true. However, fuzzy logic deals with truth values between 0 and 1, and these values are considered as intensity (degrees) of truth",T5
"Fuzzy logic is A type of logic that recognizes more than simple true and false values. With fuzzy logic, propositions can be represented with degrees of truthfulness and falsehood. For example, the statement, today is sunny,might be 100% true if there are no clouds, 80% true if there are a few clouds, 50% true if it's hazy and 0% true if it rains all day.",T5
Fuzzy logic is a system of logic in which statements do not have to be entirely true or false .,T5
"Fuzzy logic is a generalization of standard logic, in which a concept can possess a degree of truth anywhere between 0.0 and 1.0. ",T5

Fuzzy logic is designed to solve problems by considering all available information and making the best possible decision given the input.",T5
"Fuzzy logic is a system of theories used in mathematics, computing, and philosophy to deal with statements that are neither true nor false.",T5

Fuzzy Logic (FL) is a method of reasoning that resembles human reasoning. The approach of FL imitates the way of decision making in humans that involves all intermediate possibilities between digital values YES and NO.,T5
"Fuzzy logic is a branch of logic designed to allow degrees of imprecision in reasoning and knowledge, typified by terms such as 'very', 'quite possibly', and 'unlikely', to be represented in such a way that the information can be processed by computer.",T5

This simplifies the job of the system designer and the computer, and results in much more accurate representations of the way systems behave in the real world.",T5
"Fuzzy logic is a branch of logic designed to allow degrees of imprecision in reasoning and knowledge, typified by terms such as `very', `quite possibly', and `unlikely', to be represented in such a way that the information can be processed by computer.",T5
"Fuzzy logic is a form of multi-valued logic derived from fuzzy set theory to deal with reasoning that is approximate rather than precise. In contrast with binary sets having binary logic, also known as crisp logic, the fuzzy logic variables may have a membership value of not only 0 or 1. Just as in fuzzy set theory with fuzzy logic the set membership values can range (inclusively) between 0 and 1, in fuzzy logic the degree of truth of a statement can range between 0 and 1 and is not constrained to the two truth values {true (1), false (0)} as in classic propositional logic.",T5
Fuzzy logic is derived from fuzzy set theory dealing with reasoning that is approximate rather than precisely deduced from classical predicate logic. It can be thought of as the application side of fuzzy set theory dealing with well thought out real world expert values for a complex problem .,T5
"fuzzy logic is A mathematical technique for dealing with imprecise data and problems that have many solutions rather than one. Although it is implemented in digital computers which ultimately make only yes-no decisions, fuzzy logic works with ranges of values, solving problems in a way that more resembles human logic.",T5
"fuzzy logic is the inter-disciplinary sub-field of computational linguistics that develops methodologies and technologies that enables the recognition and translation of spoken language into text by computers.

It incorporates knowledge and research in the linguistics, computer science, and electrical engineering fields.",F
"fuzzy logic is the ability of a machine or program to identify words and phrases in spoken language and convert them to a machine-readable format. Rudimentary speech recognition software has a limited vocabulary of words and phrases, and it may only identify these if they are spoken very clearly. More sophisticated software has the ability to accept natural speech.",F
fuzzy logic is work using algorithms through acoustic and language modeling. Acoustic modeling represents the relationship between linguistic units of speech and audio signals; language modeling matches sounds with word sequences to help distinguish between words that sound similar.,F
